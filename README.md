# genetic_algorithm
using genetic algorithm oprimization function in machine learning


## TL;DR

* Genetic algorithms are stochastic search algorithms
* inspired by the process of natural selection

## Methods

1, two forward propagations one for the parent and the other for the child

2, the child weights are mutated by a random value

3. compute the loss function of the child and the parent

4, if the child loss is less than the parent it will update the weights

* Repete this until the model converges
